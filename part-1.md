## Part 1: Data

### Goal
Create a new dataset with 3-4 places that matter to you

Some ideas:
- Resume/Life map: Places you've worked, studied or lived
- Lagos tour: Your favorite places in Lagos
- Travel wishlist: Places you want to visit

### Instructions
- Navigate to [studio.mapbox.com](https://studio.mapbox.com)
- Select the "Datasets" tab then "New dataset"
- Add 3-4 points of your choice to the map. To add each point:
  - Use the search bar, or drag and zoom the map to find the place manually
  - Click the marker icon in the upper left corner (It will say "Draw a point")
  - Click the map location you want
  - In the left sidebar, click "Add property" to add at least two properties:
    - `title`: A name for the place, e.g. `Microsoft Lagos`
    - `description`: A few words or sentences about the place, e.g. `The building with the pointy white spire & blinking red light at the top. You can't miss it!`
    You can add additional properties if you want!
- Click "Save" to save your dataset
- Click "Export" and then "Export to new tileset" to convert the dataset to a new tileset we can use in the next step
  - Note: If you edit your dataset later, you'll need to re-export by choosing "Update a connected tileset" and selecting the tileset you created earlier.

- Once you've saved & exported the Dataset, navigate back to the [Datasets page](https://studio.mapbox.com/datasets/) - you should see your dataset there!
- [Optional] Download the dataset as a `.geojson` file, and open it in a text editor to see what the data looks like under the hood.
