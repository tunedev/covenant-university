## Overview

Location data is all around us, and has become an increasingly important component of web & mobile apps users love. In this hands-on workshop, we'll learn how to build an interactive, custom web map using open data and free, open-source tools from Mapbox. Through a hands-on project, we will cover basic web mapping concepts and tools, including:
- Creating & editing map data
- Editing & styling maps with Mapbox Studio, an online map data & design tool for creating beautiful custom map styles
- Developing map applications with Mapbox GL JS, an open-source JS library for fast, interactive, WebGL-driven maps

### Goals

By completing this workshop you'll learn how to:
- Create a custom dataset with the Studio dataset editor
- Include your data in a map style & customize the map's design with the Studio style editor
- Add your custom map to a web page with Mapbox GL JS
- Make your web map interactive with event handlers
- Create a "scrollytelling" map from your own data & style

### Prerequisites

No prior experience with geographic data or web mapping is required; basic familiarity with HTML & JS will be assumed but everyone is welcome.
